A common question nanny-share question or concern is which family will host the nanny-share at their house or apartment? In this post, we're going to examine the pros and cons of hosting a nanny-share at your home vs going to someone else's home

**Pros of hosting a nanny-share in your home:**
- No commute!
- Itâ€™s a place where your child knows and a place they trust. (Where they sleep and play)
- If you need earlier or later hours, hosting at your house provides you with better control and flexibility
- No need to pack a lunch or make sure you're bringing the right supplies every week

**Cons of hosting a nanny-share in your home:**
- There is more wear and tear on your house.
- You do have to host not only the child with the things that they have - so think about putting a crib in maybe a guest room and extra high chair extra toys and maybe a box for the other person's diapers.
- There are people coming in and out of your house every day, eliminating some of your privacy
- You may need to keep your house to a cleaner standard than you're used to

**Do nanny-share's happen at just one home or can they switch back and forth?**

It's usually just one home, you're not normally switching back and forth because the things you have to store at one, but you might want to consider location number one.

- Is it close to a park, close the sidewalks or great things for your nanny to take the kids to do outside not just being inside your house?
- What is the house layout?
- Is there a great area for the kids to play that is really childproof?
- Are there pets allergies you need to aware of?
